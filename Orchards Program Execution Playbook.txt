  dependency
• Better soil structure prevents compaction and improves infiltration
• Biological diversity creates resilient ecosystems that adapt to stress

ECONOMIC GAINS:

• Yield lift: Improved nutrient availability and water efficiency directly 
  increase production
• Fertilizer reduction: Biological nutrient cycling reduces synthetic fertilizer 
  needs by 20–40% over time
• Cost savings: Reduced water usage (up to 40% in some cases) and lower input 
  costs improve margins
• Quality improvements: Better fruit/nut quality commands premium pricing

REDUCED INPUT COSTS OVER TIME:

• Year 1: Foundation building (higher initial investment)
• Years 2–3: Maintenance applications (reduced tonnage, lower costs)
• Years 4+: Self-sustaining soil biology reduces dependency on external inputs
• Long-term ROI improves each year as soil health compounds

ENHANCED WATER EFFICIENCY:

• Improved infiltration reduces runoff and increases retention
