Orchards Program - Business-to-Business (Specialty Farmer) Market Segment
Execution Playbook

============================================================================
PURPOSE OF THE DOCUMENT
============================================================================
Provide Soil Seed & Water representatives with a clear, standardized roadmap 
for targeting, engaging, selling, implementing, and supporting specialty 
orchard/vineyard clients in the Business-to-Business (Specialty Farmer) 
Market Segment.

This document establishes the full outreach-to-fulfillment system, simplifies 
field execution, and aligns all teams on how to deliver regenerative orchard 
programs using Pomona and SSW protocols.

============================================================================
MARKETING/SALES PIPELINE
============================================================================
Visual Pipeline Flow:
Lead List → Initial Outreach (Hook Point) → Nurture (Value Content) → 
Smart Calling → Site Visits → Trials/Samples → Ongoing Accounts

Each stage feeds into the next, with CRM tracking and automation at every 
step.

============================================================================
1. RESEARCH & ELIGIBILITY
============================================================================

CROP FOCUS (Expanded):
• Pistachios
• Pome fruits (apples, pears)
• Stone fruits (peaches, plums, cherries, apricots, nectarines)
• Vineyards (grapes)
• Avocados
• Citrus (oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit)
• Other high-value orchard/vineyard crops in region (research and list 
  specifically)

GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE:
• 300-mile target radius from SSW operations
• Priority mapping by crop density and market value

COMMON CROP CHALLENGES:
• Low organic matter (OM)
• Soil compaction
• Water inefficiency
• Micronutrient deficiencies
• Low water-holding capacity
• Weed pressure
