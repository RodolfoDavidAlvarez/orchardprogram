Orchards Willcox Project - Regenerative 
Soil Health Program
Location: 6601 W Black Rd, Willcox, AZ, 
Soil Health & Conservation - Soil Seed and Water


Current Situation Analysis
The Orchards Willcox Project encompasses over about 450 acres of 
producing pistachios that have reached 8-year maturity. Our assessment 
has identified several challenges in productivity and soil health that 
present a significant opportunity for yield improvement through 
comprehensive soil regeneration.

Program Objectives
Regenerate degraded soil structure - Address erosion, poor water 
infiltration, and compaction issues in sections C & D
Increase pistachio yields - Improve nut production
Decrease tree mortality - Prevent further losses
Reduce water usage as much as 40% - Implement drought 
management strategies
Establish sustainable orchard longevity - Extend productive lifespan


Key Program Components
The Regenerative Soil Health Program for Willcox Orchards is structured around several interconnected components, 
designed to work synergistically for long-term orchard health and productivity. These programs address different 
aspects of soil vitality, from foundational organic matter building to targeted microbial activation and specialized 
nutritional support.

1
Orchard Compost Blend
High-quality dairy compost applied under tree canopies to build soil organic matter, improve structure, and 
create habitat for beneficial microbes.

2
Clean Wood Fiber
Mulch application between orchard rows for erosion control, moisture retention, temperature regulation, 
and weed suppression.

3
Drench
Compost tea extract applications that inoculate soil with living microbes to enhance nutrient cycling and 
root health.

4
Mycorrhizal Backfill Mix
Specialized fungal blend applied during new plantings to establish drought-tolerant root networks and 
improve nutrient uptake.

5
Pomona Blend
Targeted micronutrient application after leaf-out to support nut development and optimize yield quality.


Program Overview: Pathway to Orchard 
Revitalization
This comprehensive program outlines a strategic, multi-phased approach to revitalize the Willcox pistachio orchards. 
Each step focuses on regenerating soil health, enhancing tree vitality, and optimizing water efficiency to significantly 
increase yield and ensure long-term sustainability.

01
Phase 1: Foundation 
Building (Winter)
Initiates comprehensive soil 
regeneration through the application 
of organic compost, clean wood 
fiber and first drench application.

02
Phase 2: Biological 
Activation (Spring)
Focuses on enhancing root zone 
activity and nutrient cycling by 
introducing beneficial microbial 
drench treatments.

03
Phase 3: Performance 
Optimization (Growing 
Season)
Maximizes yield quality and ensures 
long-term orchard health with 
targeted nutrient applications and 
ongoing maintenance strategies.

Expected Outcomes: Significant increases in pistachio yields, improved soil health and structure, reduced water 
consumption, and extended orchard longevity for sustainable production.


Critical actions during Winter - Phase 1
This section outlines the specific, sequential steps of the Regenerative Soil Health Program, designed to transform the 
Willcox pistachio orchards through targeted, impactful interventions.

1. Orchard Compost Application 1
Benefits: Rapidly enhances soil organic matter, 
improves soil structure and microbial diversity, 
increases water infiltration and nutrient 
availability. 
**Important** Prepares the organic matter in 
the soil for biology feed after drench 
application.

2 Begin wood chip delivery (100 
acres priority)
Benefits: Critical erosion control - stabilizes soil 
and prevents topsoil loss during heavy rains. 
Protects against raindrop impact and sheet 
erosion. Improves water infiltration by 50%, 
reducing runoff while increasing retention. 
Prevents the "muddy when wet, hard when 
dry" cycle observed in field. Moderates soil 
temperature, initiates fermentation process for 
regeneration, and builds soil structure over 
time. Natural weed suppression and beneficial 
organism habitat.


Orchard Compost Blend Application 
Application: Within tree drip lines (15' diameter)

Year 1: 10 tons/canopy acre compost, banded under canopy 
Every year after: Only 5 tons/canopy acre compost, banded 
under canopy 

How it works
Compost builds carbon and organic matter into sandy soils, 
improving water holding and nutrient retention. In later years, 
smaller maintenance doses keep the system topped up without 
excess cost or salt.

Tea Extract Drench Application 
(Super cost effective)

Application: Within tree drip lines (15' diameter)
Dairy compost & Worm castings blend

How it works
Extract = the biology
Compost provides the "house and pantry." Extract provides the 
"tenants" — living microbes that colonize feeder roots. This 
ensures nutrients are cycled biologically instead of just relying on 
fertilizer salts which will feed on the compost blend.


Clean Wood Fiber Application
Application: Non-canopy acres, in between orchard rows

How it works
Fiber = the shield Wood fiber mulch protects soil from sun, wind, and erosion while 
improving water infiltration and retention. The surface barrier suppresses weeds and 
moderates soil temperature. As it breaks down naturally, it builds organic matter and 
creates nutrient-rich "compost tea" that feeds the orchard during rain events.

Replacement 
(Super cost effective)

Application: 1/3 blend, 2/3 native soil
Mycorrhizal Blend 

How it works
Mycorrhiza = the network mycorrhizal fungi colonize external 
root systems, creating a symbiotic network that dramatically 
improves drought tolerance and nutrient uptake. Applied at 
planting, this one-time treatment lasts the tree's entire 
lifespan. The cost is 10x less than trying to establish mycorrhizal 
connections on mature trees, making it essential for replacement 
plantings and new orchards.

Before and after bud break - Phase 2
This section outlines the specific, sequential steps of the Regenerative Soil Health Program, designed to transform the 
Willcox pistachio orchards through targeted, impactful interventions.

First orchard drench before bud 1
break
Timed application of compost tea extract 
before trees exit dormancy (February–March).

Benefits: Activates soil biology when trees 
need it most, preparing root systems for 
explosive spring growth. Delivers readily 
available nutrients precisely when energy 
demands spike for flowering and leaf 
development. Enhances phosphorus and 
micronutrient availability critical for bud 
differentiation. Strengthens natural disease 
resistance before growing season pathogens 
emerge. Maximizes water use efficiency as 
temperatures rise.

2 Pomona Blend Application (After 
Leaf Out)
2 cups per tree, after trees have fully leafed 
out (April–May).

Benefits: Provides specific nutritional support 
when trees can safely absorb nutrients without 
burning. Delivers critical zinc and trace 
elements during active photosynthesis period. 
Directly impacts nut development and filling 
stages. Ensures optimal micronutrient levels 
throughout growing season. Maximizes yield 
quality by supporting metabolic processes 
during peak demand.

Second Orchard Drench 3
Before nut set (June - July)
Plant requires more fertile, when it start nuting 
it will take another wave of energy this is why 
we wan to do another microbial boost, this 
increases nutrient cycle forsupport. The quality 
of the nut has to do with procress of the nut 
cycle .and maybe more important since this is 
direclty to the quality of the nuts
