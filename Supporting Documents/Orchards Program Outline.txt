Orchards Program 
Table of Contents
1. Purpose of the Document
The purpose of this document is to guide Soil Seed & Water representatives in approaching orchard farmers and helping them build healthier, more regenerative orchard ecosystems that rely less on synthetic fertilizers, strengthen soil structure, and boost biological activity through the use of Pomona and supporting SSW protocols.


2. Orchard Research and Eligibility
* Overview of key and eligible crop categories (pistachio, pome, stone fruit)
* Orchards within a 300-mile radius
* Suitability for Pomona + supporting amendments
* Common soil + fertility challenges across orchards
3. Value Proposition
* Orchard protocols
* Supplement blend
* Farmer benefits
* Economic value drivers (yield strength, soil health, fertilizer reduction, long-term ROI)
* Why SSW is different (production capacity, consistency, field support)
4. Outreach Strategy
* Identifying orchard owners
* Smart calling framework
* Contact acquisition process
* First-touch message (call/email/text)
* Discovery questions
5. Lead Nurturing Strategy
* Post-contact nurture sequence (5-email series)
* Follow-up cadence
* Education → credibility → proposal flow
* CRM steps
6. Sales Process
* Qualification steps
* Scheduling site visits
* Proposal structure
* Pricing logic (per acre / per tree)
* Closing steps
7. Implementation
* Soil test → protocol → schedule
* Application plan (Pomona ratios, seasonal timing)
* On-site coordination
* Equipment + logistics overview
8. Order Fulfillment
* Material preparation (bag, tote, bulk, truckload)
* Delivery workflow
* On-farm placement + instructions
* Paperwork + billing steps
9. Monitoring Process
* 30/60/90-day follow-ups
* Field observations
* Adjustments to ratios or application
* End-of-season review
10. Appendix
* Pomona spec sheet
* Generalized orchard protocol
* Smart calling script
* Email sequence templates
* Maps of target orchards
* Example proposals
