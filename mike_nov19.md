Orchards Program Outline
Purpose of the Document Provide Soil Seed & Water reps with a clear, standardized roadmap for targeting, engaging, selling, implementing, and supporting orchard clients. This document establishes the full outreach‑to‑fulfillment system, simplifies field execution, and aligns all teams on how to deliver regenerative orchard programs using Pomona and SSW protocols.

Research & Eligibility

Key crop categories: pistachio, pome, stone fruit

Focus: 300‑mile target radius

Common crop challenges: low OM, compaction, water inefficiency, micronutrient deficiencies, low water‑holding capacity, weeds, low microbial activity, poor nutrient uptake

Common farmer challenges: limited equipment, soil knowledge gaps, logistics constraints

Value Proposition

What: Long‑term orchard health + regeneration

Why: Orchard lifespan, soil health, economic gains (yield lift, fertilizer reduction)

How: Orchard treatment with protocols + supplement blends

Why SSW is Different: Partnership, expertise, production capacity, consistency, field support, consulting, trucking, equipment support

Hi Rodolfo,

Thanks for putting together the Business-to-Business (Specialty Farmer) Market Segment Execution Deck. I like the direction and want to suggest a few refinements to make it more actionable and complete.

1. Clarify the market segment and title
   Please make it clear that this deck is for the Business-to-Business (Specialty Farmer) Market Segment. Add this to the title and introductory framing.

2. Expand the crop focus
   In addition to pistachios, please broaden the specialty orchard category to include:

Vineyards (grapes)

Avocados

Citrus

Any other high-value orchard/vineyard crops in our region (do a little research and list them specifically)

This will show wider applicability and improve the deck’s value across markets.

3. Add a clear marketing/sales pipeline graphic
   Include a visual pipeline such as:
   Lead List → Initial Outreach (Hook Point) → Nurture (Value Content) → Smart Calling → Site Visits → Trials/Samples → Ongoing Accounts

A single clean graphic that anchors the entire process.

4. Integrate the CRM into every stage
   We need a slide (or two) showing exactly how the CRM will be used. Include:

Lead Capture: All avocado/citrus/vineyard/pistachio growers mapped on Dec 15 are entered into the CRM with complete profiles.

Segmentation: Tag by crop type, region, priority level, acreage, water source, and buying potential.

Automations:

Hook Point email/text campaign automated in the CRM (Jan 1 launch).

Value-message drip (Jan 15) scheduled directly from the CRM.

Tracking:

Open/click rates and responses tracked weekly in the CRM.

Activity timelines showing emails, calls, samples, and visits.

Smart Calling Workflow:

On Feb 1, call lists pulled from CRM based on engagement (opens, clicks, replies).

Notes, objections, next steps logged after each call.

Farm Visits:

Calendar integration inside the CRM for monthly field visit scheduling.

Add photos, soil notes, and product recommendations directly in the record.

Deals & Conversions:

Move growers through pipeline stages (Lead → Engaged → Visit → Trial → Customer).

Reporting:

Weekly dashboards for leads, conversions, response rates, and projected revenue.

Include a CRM screenshot or mock-up if helpful.

5. Build out the timeline with concrete tasks and examples
   Please add the following:

Dec 15, 2024 – Research and map all avocado, citrus, vineyard, and other specialty growers. All entered and tagged in the CRM.

Jan 1, 2025 – Finalize the Hook Point message and load it into CRM as an outbound campaign. Show 1–2 examples.

Jan 15, 2025 – Deploy short “value messages” or videos from the CRM as scheduled drip content.

Weekly (2025) – Use Google Analytics + CRM analytics to track engagement. Add a note on how we’ll review these metrics.

Feb 1, 2025 – Begin Smart Calling, pulling lists from CRM based on engagement.

2025 Monthly – Spend one week each month on site visits. Use CRM to document soil issues, conversations, photos, etc.

2025 Tradeshow Calendar – List relevant events, include tradeshow protocols, and add pre/post-show workflows into CRM.

Communication Template (Sean Example) – Show the layered, multi-channel communication sequence used successfully with Sean, and indicate how that sequence will be uploaded into CRM for this segment.

Newsletters – Add a plan for consistent orchard/vineyard-focused newsletters using CRM email tools.

Samples and Gifts – Include sending 9 lb trial bags plus branded candies, entered into CRM as activities and follow-up reminders.

These additions will turn the deck into a true execution playbook rather than a conceptual outline.

Let me know if you need any clarification, and please send a revised version once updated.

Thanks,
Mike
